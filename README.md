 cGANs are an advanced form of GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) that conditionally generate images based on given input images, enabling the transformation of images from one domain to another.

Key Objectives:

Model Overview: Understand the architecture of cGANs, which consist of a generator and a discriminator network. The generator creates images based on input conditions, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity relative to real images.
Image Translation: Implement cGANs to perform various image-to-image translation tasks, such as converting sketches to photos, day to night, or enhancing image resolution.
Evaluation: Assess the quality and fidelity of the translated images using metrics such as visual realism, accuracy, and the preservation of key features from the source images.
